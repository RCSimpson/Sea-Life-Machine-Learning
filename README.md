## About The Project
 In this project I collect images from the interest of varied sea-life using a web-scrapper that interacts with bing images to save all images it comes across given a certain search query. I then sorted cleaned and homogenized those images so that a neural network could be easily trained by passing images through and allowing the neural network to look for commonalities between images of a certain type.
